								<p>Design is not just for designers or aesthetics &amp; beauty nerds. Design is for everybody. Design is everywhere. It is a communication layer; an adapter from information to perception that, though cosidered to be more of an art by some, in a lot of cases is based on scientific researches, theorems, rules. Psychology, Algebra, Geometry and their derivatives. All of these form design principles and design tools, that conduct perception of a user.</p>
								<p>Front-end developer is a craftsman who takes the material and turns it into a product. To utilize the material wisely and effectively one should understanding material's properties and limitations. It is even more important in the times of responsive web when getting ready design for any possible screen width is close to impossible and it becomes developer's responsibility to make design-related decisions.</p>
								<p>The talk will cover basics that every front-end developer needs to understand when working with a design. How to "read" design and how to make that information help you build consistent, attractive and solid products.</p>

								<p>The Application Cache is one of the cool bits of HTML5, allowing sites to work without a network connection brings us much closer to native app-like behaviour. However, from HTML5 roundup articles and talks you may be left with the impression that it's a magic-bullet fix, unfortunately it isn't, the Application Cache is a douchebag.</p>

								<p>I don't mean 'incompetent' or 'difficult', definitely 'douchebag'. The Application Cache has skills we need, but if you asked him to paint your bathroom he'd somehow manage to flood your kitchen and break your TV in the process, and he wouldn't care.</p>

								<p>We'll look at how to use the features of Application Cache without the horrible side effects, comparing techniques you'd use for a simple clientside app and a large content-driven site. We'll explore the many gotchas left out of most AppCache articles and how you can build your site to survive them.</p>

								Ten years later, he finally gathered enough energy to write another one: the usability testing handbook Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems.</p>

								<p>The books were based on the 20+ years he’s spent as a usability consultant for a wide variety of clients like Apple, Bloomberg.com, Lexus.com, NPR, the International Monetary Fund, and many others.</p>

								<p>His consulting firm, <a class="external" href="http://sensible.com">Advanced Common Sense</a> (“just me and a few well-placed mirrors”) is based in Chestnut Hill, MA.</p>

								<p>These are all true if you have to hire someone to do it for you. But Steve Krug will show you that you can--and should--be doing it yourself, and that DIY testing is simple, inexpensive, fast, and most of all, effective.</p>
